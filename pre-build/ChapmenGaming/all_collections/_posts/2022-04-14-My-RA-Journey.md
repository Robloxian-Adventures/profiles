**MY JOURNEY THROUGH RA**

I’m an RA overseer. This means, I look over S&R & RATA while being in constant communication with the Director and Deputy regarding different issues and changes to the departments which are then reported to RA Executives. I make sure the departments are running smoothly while myself and the other RA executives do other behind the scenes administrative work. Not only do I give advice and oversee all of S&R & RATA, but I keep busy helping with any other jobs that are assigned to me. I personally try to interact with the community in public chats often so if you happen to catch me make sure to say hi.

My time in RA had just started under a month of being in RATA. I believe that I had already gained the certified guide role from being in RATA and the RATA trainers role but for months, I was sitting with those roles as I didn’t try and become a staff member within RA until not that long ago, I applied to become a trial moderator. By doing this, it would help me in many ways not just within the moderation industry but also as a RATA Instructor as it would allow me to host a variety of training without issues with the admin. RA has helped me in many ways the same as every other server but RA has specifically helped me become a better Moderator from the training I have received from becoming a trial moderator. Since I’ve been in RA I have had many great times one of them being the 9/11 memorial we held on Everest to memorise the lost and fallen.
