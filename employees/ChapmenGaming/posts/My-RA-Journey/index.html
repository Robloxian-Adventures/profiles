My time in RA had just started under a month of being in RATA. I believe that I had already gained the certified guide role from being in RATA and the RATA trainers role but for months, I was sitting with those roles as I didn’t try and become a staff member within RA until not that long ago, I applied to become a trial moderator. By doing this, it would help me in many ways not just within the moderation industry but also as a RATA Instructor as it would allow me to host a variety of training without issues with the admin. RA has helped me in many ways the same as every other server but RA has specifically helped me become a better Moderator from the training I have received from becoming a trial moderator. Since I’ve been in RA I have had many great times one of them being the 9/11 memorial we held on Everest to memorise the lost and fallen.</p>
